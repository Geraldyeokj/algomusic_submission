# Written Reflection

## Creative Process

I wanted to musically represent a cool algorithm that produced infinitely variable outputs. I initially thought of graph traversal algorithms like DFS, Dijkstra's, and Kahn's Algorithm. I also thought of The collatz conjecture. However, I realised that is is difficult for people to use graphs as musical instruments as they get unwieldy really quickly. I also realised that the collatz conjecture would produce outputs that may be too random to be a musical instrument or an algorithmic composition.
